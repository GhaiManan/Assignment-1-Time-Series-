# Assignment-1-Time-Series
## Introduction
The assignment was based on the concept of time series data. The assignment consisted of data collected by IOT sensors along different sections of a 25 Km road.
The data was gathered for a period of 10 years based on 13 parameters. Our task was to predict the data value for the 10th year for parameters 9-13 for all the
sections of the road.

## Methodology Used
To perform the required task, I made use of the **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA)**. It explicitly caters to a suite of standard structures in time series data, and as such provides a simple yet powerful method for making skillful time series forecasts.

## Results
Using the ARIMA model, I got a **RMSE score of 37.438**.
